 Day 17 – 17 July 2025 (Thursday)

 Topic: Project Work Continued – AgrosolAR (Smart Solar System)

 Tasks Performed:
- Continued implementation of AgrosolAR solar tracking system
- Replaced SG90 Servo Motor with a **DC Gear Motor** for better rotation and torque
- Controlled DC Gear Motor directly using relay module and ESP32 logic
- Adjusted rotation logic based on LDR sensor values to track sunlight
- Performed successful testing of directional rotation towards brighter light source
- Improved the mechanical structure to handle gear motor movement

 Concepts Applied:
- Basics of **DC Gear Motor** working and connections
- Real-time sensor-based control for solar tracking
- Relay-based motor switching (forward/reverse)
- Mechanical balancing of solar panel system

 Reflections:
The DC gear motor gave us more control and power compared to the servo. Since we didn’t use L298N, we had to rely on basic relay logic which was a bit tricky but effective. The solar panel now rotates more reliably based on sunlight direction.
