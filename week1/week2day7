# Day 7 - 03-07-2025 (Thursday)
**Smart Fusion Training â€“ Week 2**

## Topics Covered:
- Data Visualization in Python
- Introduction to Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries
- Plotting graphs using `pyplot`
- Types of graphs:
  - Line Plot
  - Bar Chart
  - Scatter Plot
  - Histogram
  - Pie Chart

## Key Learnings:
- Matplotlib is used for creating static, interactive, and animated plots.
- Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib and makes complex plots easier.
- Different types of plots are used for different purposes:
  - Line Plot: for trends
  - Bar Chart: for category comparisons
  - Scatter Plot: to show relationships
  - Histogram: to show data distribution
  - Pie Chart: to show proportions
- Learned how to customize graphs with:
  - Titles, labels, colors, legends, and gridlines
- Understood basic syntax of `pyplot` and styling techniques.

## Activities Done:
- Practiced creating different types of charts using student data
- Used the following Python libraries:
  - `matplotlib.pyplot`
  - `seaborn`
- Created:
  - Line graph for student scores over time
  - Bar graph for subject-wise marks
  - Scatter plot for two variable analysis
  - Histogram for mark frequency
  - Pie chart for subject-wise percentage share
- Applied labels, legends, colors, and layout options

## Tasks Given:
- Use your student data (`student_data.csv`)
- Create the following visualizations:
  - Line Plot
  - Bar Chart
  - Scatter Plot
  - Histogram
  - Pie Chart
- Add appropriate:
  - Labels
  - Titles
  - Legends
  - Color customization

## Doubts / Questions:
- How to plot multiple charts in one figure using `plt.subplot()`?
- When should we use Seaborn over Matplotlib?
- Which chart type is best for categorical vs numerical data?

## Reflections:
Today was one of the most interactive and creative sessions. I learned how to represent raw data using beautiful graphs. It helped me see the hidden patterns in the data, and I now feel more confident in using visualization tools in Python for reports and dashboards.

## Tasks for Tomorrow:
- Learn about EDA (Exploratory data analysis)
