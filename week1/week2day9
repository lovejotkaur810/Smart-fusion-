## Key Learnings:

### üß† What is Learning?
- **Learning** is the process where a system improves its performance on a task with experience.
- In ML, learning means adjusting the model parameters based on data to make better predictions.

### ü§ñ What is Machine Learning (ML)?
- A subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to **learn from data** and make predictions or decisions.
- No hard-coding needed ‚Äî models **learn patterns** from past examples.

### üîç What is Deep Learning (DL)?
- A subset of ML that uses **neural networks with many layers** (hence ‚Äúdeep‚Äù) to automatically extract complex features.
- Mostly used in **image recognition**, **speech processing**, **NLP**, etc.

### üìö Types of Learning in ML:

| Learning Type       | Description                                             | Examples                         |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Supervised**      | Learn from labeled data                                 | Regression, Classification       |
| **Unsupervised**    | Learn from unlabeled data                               | Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction |
| **Semi-Supervised** | Mix of labeled and unlabeled data                       | Used when labeling is costly     |
| **Reinforcement**   | Learn by reward/punishment from environment             | Game-playing AI, Robotics        |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Types of ML Algorithms:

1. **Regression Algorithms** ‚Äì Predict continuous values  
   _Example: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression_

2. **Classification Algorithms** ‚Äì Predict categories  
   _Example: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM_

3. **Clustering Algorithms** ‚Äì Group similar items  
   _Example: K-Means, DBSCAN_

4. **Dimensionality Reduction** ‚Äì Reduce features  
   _Example: PCA (Principal Component Analysis)_

### üìà Linear Regression ‚Äì Explained:

**Purpose:**  
To model the relationship between one or more independent variables (X) and a dependent variable (Y), where Y is continuous.

**Equation:**  
\[
Y = mX + c
\]
Where:
- `m` is the slope (weight/parameter)
- `c` is the intercept (bias)
- `X` is the input (independent variable)
- `Y` is the output (predicted value)

**Steps in Linear Regression:**
1. Collect training data (X, Y)
2. Fit a line that minimizes error (using cost function)
3. Make predictions using the line equation

**Loss Function Used:**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:
\[
MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum (Y_{actual} - Y_{predicted})^2
\]

**Used For:**
- Predicting marks, salary, temperature, house prices, etc.

**In Python (Scikit-learn):**
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
