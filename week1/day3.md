# Day 3 - 27-06-2025
**4-Week Training on Smart Fusion**

## üìù Topics Covered:
- Introduction to **Cloud Computing** in IoT
- Overview of **ThingSpeak** platform
- Importance of IoT data logging and visualization
- Weekly Assignment + Mini Project:
  - **Read sensor data and log it to the cloud using ThingSpeak**

## üß† Key Learnings:
- **Cloud Computing in IoT** allows devices to store, process, and access data remotely.
- Benefits:
  - Remote access
  - Real-time monitoring
  - Scalable data storage
- **ThingSpeak**:
  - Cloud platform used to collect and visualize sensor data
  - Offers easy integration with microcontrollers (like Arduino, NodeMCU)
  - Supports public and private data channels
- Data from sensors (e.g., DHT11) can be sent to ThingSpeak via API for live monitoring.

## üíª Activities Done:
- Learned how cloud services support IoT applications
- Explored ThingSpeak dashboard and data channel creation
- Understood API keys and how to send data using HTTP requests
- Weekly assignment and mini project announced:
  - Task: Interface sensor (e.g., DHT11) with board and log live data to ThingSpeak

## ü§î Doubts / Questions:
- What are the limitations of free ThingSpeak channels?
- How to ensure data is sent reliably over poor internet connections?

## ‚úÖ Tasks for Tomorrow (Day 4):
- Hands-on practice: send DHT11 data to ThingSpeak
- Learn how to visualize data using charts
- Explore basic data analysis and alert setup on ThingSpeak
