# Day 8 – 04-07-2025 (Friday)
**Smart Fusion Training – Week 2**

## Topics Covered:
- Complete overview of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Importance and role of EDA in data science and ML
- Assignment 2 and Mini Project 2 given

## Key Learnings:
- **EDA** is the first and most important step in data analysis
- It involves:
  - Understanding data types and structure
  - Detecting missing or incorrect values
  - Identifying outliers and data ranges
  - Summarizing statistics (mean, median, std dev, etc.)
  - Finding relationships using visualizations (scatter, heatmap, etc.)
- Tools and libraries used for EDA:
  - **Pandas** for data handling
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for plotting
- Learned how to:
  - Use `df.describe()` for statistical summary
  - Use `df.info()` and `df.isnull().sum()` for data checks
  - Create pair plots, heatmaps, box plots for analysis
- EDA helps improve model accuracy by understanding data deeply before training

## Activities Done:
- Performed EDA on student marks dataset
- Checked for:
  - Missing values
  - Outliers using boxplot
  - Correlation between subjects using heatmap
- Visualized distributions using histograms and scatter plots
- Explored data quality issues and planned for cleaning

## Assignment 2:
**Perform EDA on any real or synthetic dataset**
- Include:
  - Summary statistics
  - Missing value handling
  - At least 3 different types of plots (bar, histogram, box, scatter, etc.)
- Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Submit as a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) or Colab link

## Mini Project 2:
**Design and implement a real-time data dashboard using Python**
- Requirements:
  - At least **two live-updating graphs**
  - **Display of sensor values** (e.g., temperature, humidity)
- Tech allowed:
  - Python + libraries like `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `dash`, `streamlit`
  - Simulated sensor data or real-time using `random` or IoT (e.g., DHT11 on Wokwi)
- Deliverables:
  - Python code
  - Screenshot or screen recording of working dashboard

## Doubts / Questions:
- Which library is best for real-time graphs: Matplotlib or Streamlit?
- How to simulate sensor data updates every few seconds?
- Can we embed a real-time IoT feed into a Python dashboard?

## Reflections:
Today I got full clarity on how data is explored before being modeled. The EDA process gave me confidence in handling new datasets. The mini project looks exciting as I will now build a live dashboard — which feels like real industry work.

## Tasks for Tomorrow:
- Start working on Assignment 2 (EDA notebook)
- Research Python dashboard tools (Streamlit / Plotly Dash)
- Begin planning live-graph integration for Mini Project 2
