📅 Day 15 – 15 July 2025 (Tuesday)

🔷 Topic: Continued Project Work – AgrosolAR

🛠️ Tasks Performed:
- Finalized circuit design and block diagram for the solar tracking system
- Researched suitable solar tracking algorithms (e.g., dual LDR-based tracking)
- Created component list with pricing (Servo SG90, LDRs, ESP32, solar panel)
- Tested individual components for functionality
- Started basic coding for solar panel rotation using servo and LDR logic
- Worked on project folder structure on GitHub for documentation

📘 Concepts Applied:
- LDR sensor integration with ESP32
- dc gear motor control based on light intensity
- Project planning and task delegation
- Embedding real-time hardware logic in code

🧠 Reflections:
We made solid progress in bringing the AgrosolAR system to life. Interfacing sensors and motors gave a hands-on feel to the learning. Tomorrow we aim to test our first working prototype.
