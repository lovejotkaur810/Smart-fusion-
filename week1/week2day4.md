# Day 4 - 30-06-2025
**4-Week Training on Smart Fusion**

##  Topics Covered:
- Introduction to **Data Acquisition in IoT**
- **Sensor interfacing** using **ESP32** and **DHT22**
- Reading temperature and humidity data using **Arduino code**
- Connecting **ESP32** to Wi-Fi using **Wokwi simulation**
- Sending sensor data to **ThingSpeak** using HTTP GET request
- Viewing **real-time data graphs** on ThingSpeak

##  Key Learnings:
- **Data Acquisition** involves collecting real-world data (e.g., temp/humidity) using sensors and sending it to the cloud.
- **ESP32** is a powerful microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi used to send sensor data to the cloud.
- **DHT22** is a digital sensor used for measuring temperature and humidity.
- **Wokwi** is an online simulation platform that allows testing of microcontroller projects without physical hardware.
- Sensor values can be sent to ThingSpeak via **HTTP GET request** using the **Write API key**.
- Data can be visualized using ThingSpeak graphs in real time.

##  Activities Done:
- Simulated ESP32 and DHT22 connection on Wokwi
- Wrote and uploaded Arduino code to read sensor data
- Configured Wi-Fi credentials in code for ESP32
- Used HTTP GET request to send data to ThingSpeak
- Observed live temperature and humidity graphs on ThingSpeak dashboard

## âœ… Task Given:
- Simulate ESP32 and DHT22 using Wokwi
- Write code to acquire sensor data and send to ThingSpeak
- Use **ThingSpeak API key** and validate channel data successfully

##  Doubts / Questions:
- How accurate is Wokwi simulation compared to real hardware?
- Can we connect multiple sensors to one ESP32 and one ThingSpeak channel?
- What happens if Wi-Fi disconnects during data transmission?
