##  Day 11 – 9 July 2025 (Wednesday)

### Topics Covered:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm
- How to choose the right algorithm for ML projects
- Concept of Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy & Precision Formula
- Project Title Finalization & Objective Writing

###  Guided By:
Training Instructor

###  Concepts Learned:
- KNN is used for classification based on nearest data points
- Steps: Choose K, calculate distances, pick K nearest, assign most common class
- KNN is simple, works well for small datasets
- Confusion Matrix helps evaluate classification results
- Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
- Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
- Different algorithms perform differently based on data type and size

###  Tools / Platforms Used:
- Python (scikit-learn)
- Colab / Jupyter Notebook

###  Tasks Performed:
- Understood how KNN works with real data
- Compared different algorithms to use for our ML + IoT project
- Discussed confusion matrix and its importance in evaluation
- Finalized our project title and noted down its objective
- Assigned to read review paper and methodology for project preparation

###  Project Work:
- Finalized project title
- Wrote basic objectives and discussed possible ML models to use

###  Reflections:
KNN was easy to understand and gave clarity on how predictions are made. Confusion matrix added a new way to judge model performance. Finalizing the project made today’s session feel more real and focused.
