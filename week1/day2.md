# Day 2 - 26-06-2025
**4-Week Training on Smart Fusion**

## 📝 Topics Covered:
- Detailed **IoT Architecture**
- **Sensors** and **Smart Sensors**
- **Actuators** and **Smart Actuators**
- Introduction to specific components:
  - **DHT11** (Temperature & Humidity Sensor)
  - **PIR** (Motion Detection Sensor)
  - **LED** as output actuator

## 🧠 Key Learnings:
- **IoT Architecture** has three main layers:
  - **Perception Layer** – physical sensors and actuators
  - **Network Layer** – transfers data (e.g., Wi-Fi, Zigbee)
  - **Application Layer** – processes and uses the data
- **Sensor**: A device that detects events or changes (e.g., DHT11 for temperature/humidity)
- **Smart Sensor**: Has inbuilt processing to filter or transmit only meaningful data
- **Actuator**: Performs physical action (e.g., turning on an LED or motor)
- **Smart Actuator**: Can take decisions based on processed data (e.g., auto-fan system)
- **DHT11**: Digital sensor that measures both temperature and humidity
- **PIR Sensor**: Detects motion by sensing infrared emitted from bodies
- **LED**: Acts as an actuator to give visual output (e.g., ON/OFF based on condition)

## 💻 Activities Done:
- Understood how different layers in IoT architecture work together
- Hands-on explanation of how DHT11 and PIR sensors function
- Learned how an LED can act as an actuator in IoT projects


## 🤔 Doubts / Questions:
- How are smart sensors programmed to filter data?
- What’s the difference between analog and digital sensors in practice?
