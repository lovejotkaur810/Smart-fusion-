# Day 5 - 01-07-2025
**4-Week Training on Smart Fusion**

##  Topics Covered:
1. **Detection of Light** using a **photoresistor (LDR)**
2. **Interfacing servo motor with Arduino**

##  Key Learnings:
- **Photoresistor (LDR)** is a light-sensitive resistor that decreases resistance as light intensity increases.
- It is used in applications like light sensors, smart lighting, and auto street lamps.
- **Arduino** can read analog light values from the LDR and take decisions (like turning on a servo motor or LED).
- **Servo Motor** rotates to specific angles based on control signals and is useful in precision applications like robotics.
- **Interfacing LDR and Servo** allows us to build smart systems that react to changes in light.

## Activities Done:
- Interfaced a photoresistor with Arduino and read analog light values
- Used those readings to control a **servo motor** (e.g., rotate when it gets dark)
- Practiced code to map LDR values to servo angles
- Learned the connection and pin configuration for servo and LDR modules

##  Task Given:
- Complete a mini-project: **Light-controlled servo motor**
  - Use LDR to detect brightness level
  - Move servo based on light condition (e.g., open blinds or turn panel)
  - Simulate or test using Arduino or Wokwi platform

##  Doubts / Questions:
- How to smooth out noisy sensor values from LDR?
- Can we combine multiple sensors (LDR + PIR + DHT) in a single project?
